# Intraday Dash 

## A free trading tool providing real-time stock data and up to date economic releases and news events

### Designed for equity day traders that trade using more than one monitor.  Intraday Dash is designed to give an up to the minute snap shot of world markets

**Goals:**

* For traders to at a glance identify:
    1. If the dollar is strong or weak compared to other currencies
    2. How the dollar is effecting risk off assets
    3. How oil is moving and if equities and oil are moving in the same direction
    4. How the European and UK markets have performed ahead of the US open
    5. Where US equity indexes are priced on the open and if they are all in line with each other
    6. What time significant economic events are being released and what news is driving the markets 

* To present all the above information in a condensed and well laid out manner so the information can be quickly absorbed. interpreted and acted on
* To achieve this using the least amount of screen real estate as possible

This is my first 'free-hand' project during my hmtl and css training, therefore this project will utilise:

* CSS Grid & Flexbox
* Use of third party charts and data feeds via Iframes
* css styling created manually without the use of Bootstrap (for practise) 

# Update:

Intraday-Dash as a charting tool has leant itself well to the css Grid system. During the initial crude mock up of the page it has become clear that my initial goals are not only achievable but that this project should be far more ambitous.  Because of this I am continuing this project in a new repository with a deeper foundation that will be utilising Bootstrap and include multiple trading dashboards and more features. As my first mini project during my training I will leave this repo open to show my development. Link to the main project: [TraderDash](#)

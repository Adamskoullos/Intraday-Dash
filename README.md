# Intraday Dash 

## A free trading tool providing real-time stock data and up to date economic releases and news events

### Designed for equity day traders that trade using more than one monitor.  Intraday Dash is designed to take up half of one 27" screen and give an up to the minute snap shot of world markets

**Goals:**

* For traders to at a glance identify:
    1. If the dollar is strong or weak compared to other currencies
    2. Where the 5yr yield is
    3. How gold is moving compared to the dollar
    4. How oil is moving and if equities and oil are moving in the same direction
    5. How the European and UK markets have performed ahead of the US open
    6. Where US equity indexes are priced on the open and if they are all in line with each other
    7. What time significant economic events are being released and what news is driving the markets 

* To present all the above information in a condensed and well laid out manner so the information can be quickly absorbed. interpreted and acted on
* To achieve this using the least amount of screen real estate as possible

This is my first project during hmtl and css training, therefore this project will utilise:

* CSS Grid & Flexbox
* Use of third party charts and data feeds via Iframes
* css styling created manually without the use of Bootstrap (for practise)
